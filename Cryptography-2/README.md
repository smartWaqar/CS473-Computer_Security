This contians my implementation of Set 2 of http://cryptopals.com

Some (not all) if these is implemented. Those which are not implemented have imbiguity in them.

1. Implement PKCS#7 padding
2. Implement CBC mode
3. An ECB/CBC detection oracle
4. Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Simple)
5. ECB cut-and-paste
6. Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Harder)
7. PKCS#7 padding validation
8. CBC bitflipping attacks
